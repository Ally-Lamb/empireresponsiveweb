						<h3><a href="#">Uniform</a></h3>
						<p>Empire recently have changed their uniforms to straight black jackets with gold trimmings and piping.
							They wear the Shimmer tights from company Dancewear as well as their black belts and iconic Crown brand
							on each upper sleeve. The hats were reused from previous years however a new red feather is now displayed
							running up the hat and being the only team in NZ to commit to black boots has seen this team stand out like no other.

					<h2>Empire take out <span>Canterbury Championships 2022!</span></h2>
					<p>With the confirmation that the Marching New Zealand Championships had been cancelled due to Covid 19's Omicron
						variant, Empire held a team meeting at the start of February to see whether the team wished to continue competing
						the second half of the season. <br><br>
						As the teams commitment to the season had not wavered, entry into the Canterbury Championships commenced and the Team
						proceeded with their trainings under the Sports NZ guidelines. 
						Competing against other Canterbury Senior teams where the closeness in points had teams alternating on titles week to week, 
						Empire took out the title of winning 1st Technical Drill team and 1st overall Canterbury Champion Senior Team, a first time
						for the team who have been strongly competing in the Canterbury association for 6 years.
